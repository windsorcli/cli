The Windsor Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool designed to streamline your workflow and enhance productivity. With a small suite of intuitive commands, the Windsor CLI allows you to efficiently manage contexts for other tools in your development environment.

## [Purpose](#purpose)

The Windsor CLI is designed to simplify and enhance the development workflow for developers working on various projects. Its primary purpose is to provide a unified command-line interface that streamlines project setup, configuration management, and integration with other tools. 

By offering a consistent and efficient way to manage "contexts", the Windsor CLI aims to reduce the time and effort required for repetitive tasks, allowing developers to focus more on coding and less on setup and configuration.

Key objectives of the Windsor CLI include:

- **Efficiency**: Start with a pre-configured, working, and fully functional environment.
- **Consistency**: Ensure a standardized approach and consistent tool usage across different environments and teams.
- **Flexibility**: Support a wide range of configurations and integrations to accommodate diverse project needs.
- **Scalability**: Scale the environment and the production workload.
- **Project Initialization**: Quickly set up new projects with predefined configurations.
- **Configuration Management**: Easily manage and switch between different project configurations.
- **Shell Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with your shell environment for enhanced productivity.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
