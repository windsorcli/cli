# Windsor Hook
A key feature of the Windsor CLI is its ability to contextually manage your environment while working within a Windsor project. You may have encountered similar tools, in particular [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv), that make it possible to dynamically configure environment variables while you're inside a project folder. The `windsor hook` & `windsor env` system does the same, while continuing to manage your environment variables as you move throughout the subfolders within your project.

## Installing the Hook
You should have installed the hook during [installation](../install/install.md).
