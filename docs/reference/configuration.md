# Configuration

The Windsor CLI is primarily configured on a project-by-project basis. A `windsor.yaml` file should exist at the base of your project, and will be created for you on running `windsor init`.

Two categories of configuration exist. Project configuration configures details related to the project, such as the tool manager to use. Context configuration configures details specific to a particular context within your project.
